# 🚀 AutoExport

AutoExport is a Python-based GUI application that helps you export your programming assignments (Python, C++, Java, etc.) into a neatly formatted Word `.docx` document — complete with code, outputs, and visuals. It’s designed for students and developers who want to generate clean submission-ready documents with just a few clicks.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ CustomTkinter-based modern GUI
- 📄 Exports code from multiple languages into `.docx`
- 🖼️ Embeds execution output and generated visuals (currently only Python and matplotlib supported for output generation)
- 📝 Adds instructor, course, semester metadata
- 📁 Auto-select files and customize export folder
- 🔍 Optional CLI runner for batch testing

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Minimum requirements:**

```
customtkinter
pillow

## 🚀 How to Run

### GUI App:

```bash
python autoexport.py
```

### CLI Tool (optional):

### `tools/cli_runner.py`

A command-line interface utility that executes selected `.py` files from the `Programs/` directory **and its subfolders**.

- Displays a list of available programs with indexed selection.
- Supports optional logging of output and time taken.
- Automatically installs `colorama` if missing.
(More language support in new versions soon!)
